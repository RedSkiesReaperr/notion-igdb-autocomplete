This Go project aims to automate the completion of video game information in a Notion database. It simplifies the task of collecting and updating details of video games, including titles, franchises, genres, platforms, and release dates, by connecting to the Notion database.

![demo](https://github.com/RedSkiesReaperr/notion-igdb-autocomplete/assets/64477486/02de6e81-974f-4ed1-948a-e261cbd29eba)

## Key Features
- Notion Integration: Connects to your Notion database to extract and update video game information.
- Automated Search: Performs online searches to retrieve up-to-date information about video games.
- Database Updates: Updates video game entries in Notion with the latest details, such as titles, franchises, genres, platforms, and release dates.

## Prerequisites
- Go v1.21.1+ (if running on local machine)
- Make (if running on local machine)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (if running on docker)
- Access to a Notion database and a Notion integration key (see Configuration section for details)
- Access to IGDB API by a client id and client secret (see Configuration section for details)

## Installation
> This section is mandatory only if you want to download the source & run the code on your local machine. Either, you can directly go to the [Configuration section]()

To get started, you need to install Go, download the source code and install all the dependencies it needs to work properly.

### Clone the Repository
```bash
$ git  clone  https://github.com/RedSkiesReaperr/notion-igdb-autocomplete
$ cd  notion-igdb-autocomplete
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
$ go mod download
```

## Configuration
This section will help you to get all the mandatory variables from third party apps and create the base application configuration. 

### 1. Create environment configuration file: 
Create a `.env` file to save your configuration informations:
```shell
$ cp ./.env.example .env
```

#### 2. Create a Notion database
>**If you start from scratch**: Duplicate the [Notion template](https://plant-pantry-77c.notion.site/Automated-video-games-library-c833cb560feb4b82935a310e508d34c2?pvs=4) and go to step 2

>**If you already have a Notion database**: Continue to step 1

1. Create a Notion database (or configure an already existing one) with the following properties:
	- Title: (**type: Title**)
	- Platforms: (**type: Multi-select**)
	- Genres: (**type: Multi-select**)
	- Franchises: (**type: Multi-select**)
	- Release date: (**type: Date**)
	- Time to complete (Main Story): (**type: Text**)
	- Time to complete (Main + Sides): (**type: Text**)
	- Time to complete (Completionist):  (**type: Text**)
  
2. Create a private Notion integration on your account by following the [getting started page](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#create-your-integration-in-notion) before the "Setting up the demo locally" step.
3. Put your integration API secret as value of the `NOTION_API_SECRET` in your `.env` file.
4. Go on your Notion databse, click on the "..." button and on the "copy link" option. As mentionned in [environment variables section](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#environment-variables), Get the ID of your database and put it as value of the `NOTION_PAGE_ID` in your `.env` file.

> ***At this point you should have a Notion database, with all mandatory properties. You should have created a private Notion integration connected with you database. You should have a `.env` file in your cloned project directory who have two values filled: `NOTION_API_SECRET` and `NOTION_PAGE_ID`***

5. Create a Twitch Developer application (needed to use IGDB API) by following the "Account Creation" of [getting started page](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#getting-started). This will give you steps to get your `IGDB_CLIENT_ID` & `IGDB_SECRET`. Afterward fill `IGDB_CLIENT_ID` & `IGDB_SECRET` in your `.env` file. ***If you need more detailed explanations, follow the 'More details about IGDB configuration' section below***.

ðŸŽ‰ **Congrats, configuration done!** ðŸŽ‰

### More details about IGDB configuration
Once you are on the Twitch developers portal:
1. On the left menu go in the "Applications" section
2. Then click on the "Register your application" purple button
3. In the registration form:
1. Name field: you fill whatever you want.
2. Second field (about OAuth things): `http://localhost`.
3. Click on create button
4. Once created it takes you to the applications listing, then click on "Manage" button for your newly created app.
5. Under the captcha, you have a field "client identifier" (or something like that). This value is your `IGDB_CLIENT_ID`
6. Click on the "New secret" button. It gives you the `IGDB_SECRET`

## Running the Project

### Running on Local Machine

1. Compile the project:
	```bash
	$ make build
	```
2. Run the generated binary:
	```bash
	$ ./bin/app
	```

By running the app this way you will get into a nicer and clearer TUI (text-based user interface) than the more conventional way to run. You can navigate through it by using your keyboard. It will also help you to have a better understanding of whats going on. Here is a sneak peak of this TUI:

### Running with Docker

1. Pull the docker image:
	```bash
	$ docker pull redskiesreaperr/notion-igdb-autocomplete:latest
	```
2. Create and run the container, send the config values as environment variables to the container:
```bash
$ docker run \
	-e NOTION_PAGE_ID=your_notion_page_id \
	-e IGDB_CLIENT_ID=your_igdb_client_id \
	-e IGDB_SECRET=your_igdb_secret \
	-e NOTION_API_SECRET=your_notion_api_secret \
	-e REFRESH_DELAY=5 \
	redskiesreaperr/notion-igdb-autocomplete:latest
```

## Build a release image
```bash
$ docker build \
	--platform linux/386,linux/amd64,linux/arm,linux/arm64 \
	-t image:tag \
	.
```
